            Description = "A tombstone is a container object consisting of the deleted objects from AD. These objects have not been physically removed from the database. When an AD object, such as a user is deleted, the object technically remains in the directory for a given period of time; known as the Tombstone Lifetime.  At that point, Active Directory sets the ‘isDeleted' attribute of the deleted object to TRUE and moves it to a special container called Tombstone (previously known as CN=Deleted Objects.)  Once the object is older than the tombstone lifetime, it will be removed (physically deleted) by the garbage collection process."
