AD automatically and transparently creates them in a domain the first time after adding a security principal from another forest to a group from that domain. AD creates FSPs in a domain the first time after adding a security principal of a domain from another forest to a group. And when someone removes the security principal the FSP is pointing to, the FSP becomes an orphan because it points to a non-existent security principal.'
